However, strong multicollinearity is observed among the predictor variables.\n👉 Given these findings, I plan to proceed with regression modeling to formally test the statistical significance and predictive power of average rent, income, and loan amount on the approval rate, despite the low correlations observed.\n👉 I also intend to explore alternative models such as regularized regression (LASSO) to address multicollinearity and assess variable importance, and non-linear models (e.g., random forest) to capture any non-linear effects that may not be visible in the scatter plot.\nThe exploratory data analysis shows weak correlations between loan approval rate and predictors such as average rent and income, while strong correlations are present among the predictors themselves. Therefore, we plan to use linear regression, LASSO, and random forest models to further investigate the relationship. Perhaps the predictive performance of the random forest model, which is less affected by multicollinearity, is expected to be the best."

In addition, if the multicollinearity problem, which reveals a strong correlation between predictors, has been solved, better performance can be expected in the linear regression model."
