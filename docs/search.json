This balance is crucial for building an effective classification model, such as logistic regression, as it helps avoid model bias toward the majority class.\nSecond, the histogram of stem length reveals a clear distinction between species. E. californica tends to have longer stems with a wider spread, whereas E. farinosa shows a concentration of shorter stem lengths. This indicates that stem length could be a strong predictor in the classification model.\nThird, the scatter plot comparing disk diameter and ray diameter shows moderate clustering by species. While there is some overlap, the patterns suggest that a combination of these two features could help distinguish the species when used together in a multivariable model.\nLastly, the boxplot further supports the finding that E. californica generally has longer stems, with a higher median and greater variability compared to E. farinosa. Outliers are also present for E. californica, which may reflect natural variation in its growth or data entry noise.\n\n# Calculate Q1, Q3, and IQR for stem_length\nQ1 &lt;- quantile(df_extended$stem_length, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)\nQ3 &lt;- quantile(df_extended$stem_length, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\nIQR_value &lt;- Q3 - Q1\n\n# Define lower and upper bounds for outliers\nlower_bound &lt;- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR_value\nupper_bound &lt;- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR_value\n\n# Print thresholds (optional)\ncat(\"Lower Bound:\", lower_bound, \"| Upper Bound:\", upper_bound, \"\\n\")\n\nLower Bound: -14.3125 | Upper Bound: 43.7875 \n\n# Filter out rows where stem_length is an outlier\ndf_no_outliers &lt;- df_extended %&gt;%\n  filter(stem_length &gt;= lower_bound & stem_length &lt;= upper_bound)\n\n# Check how many rows were removed\nn_removed &lt;- nrow(df_extended) - nrow(df_no_outliers)\ncat(\"Number of outliers removed:\", n_removed, \"\\n\")\n\nNumber of outliers removed: 52 \n\n\nDuring the exploratory data analysis, we identified potential outliers in the stem_length variable, particularly among samples of Encelia californica. These outliers were visually evident in the boxplot, showing values that extended far beyond the typical range of the data.\nTo address this, we applied the interquartile range (IQR) method to detect and remove extreme values. Specifically, any observations with stem length values falling below Q1 − 1.5 × IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 × IQR were considered outliers and excluded from the dataset. As a result, a small number of data points were removed, allowing us to reduce the influence of extreme values that could potentially skew the model."

Why are you doing it? Logistic regression is a classification method used to predict a binary outcome using one or more predictor variables. In this case, I am using it to classify whether a plant is Encelia californica (C) or Encelia farinosa (F) based on features like stem length, ray diameter, and disk diameter.\nWhy did you choose each model that you are considering? I began with a simple model using only stem_length, then added additional predictors such as ray_diameter and disk_diameter. The third model included all available numerical variables. This progression allows to balance simplicity and performance.\nWhy are you using cross-validation? How does it work? Cross-validation helps evaluate model performance more reliably by splitting the training data into folds. The model is trained on some folds and tested on others, cycling through all combinations. This reduces the risk of overfitting and gives a more general estimate of how the model will perform on unseen data.\nWhich model are you selecting as the best model? Why? The final model was evaluated on the test set, and it achieved an accuracy of approximately 93%. This suggests the model generalizes well and can reliably classify the two Encelia species using field measurements."

Most of the misclassifications occurred where the feature values of E. californica and E. farinosa overlap—especially when E. californica had unusually short stem lengths or smaller ray diameters, making them resemble E. farinosa based on the model’s learned patterns.\nQ. Which flowers (if any) were incorrectly predicted? Why do you suspect that they were incorrectly predicted?\n–&gt; I suspect that these misclassifications were due to natural overlap in morphological characteristics between the two species. Additionally, some measurement noise or human error during data collection might have affected the clarity of class boundaries. Because logistic regression assumes a linear decision boundary, it may also struggle to correctly classify borderline cases where nonlinear relationships exist."

However, strong multicollinearity is observed among the predictor variables.\n👉 Given these findings, I plan to proceed with regression modeling to formally test the statistical significance and predictive power of average rent, income, and loan amount on the approval rate, despite the low correlations observed.\n👉 I also intend to explore alternative models such as regularized regression (LASSO) to address multicollinearity and assess variable importance, and non-linear models (e.g., random forest) to capture any non-linear effects that may not be visible in the scatter plot.\nThe exploratory data analysis shows weak correlations between loan approval rate and predictors such as average rent and income, while strong correlations are present among the predictors themselves. Therefore, we plan to use linear regression, LASSO, and random forest models to further investigate the relationship. Perhaps the predictive performance of the random forest model, which is less affected by multicollinearity, is expected to be the best."

    "text": "Key Insights & Breaking points\nIt was discovered that average income was the predictor that had the greatest impact on the loan approval rate.\nHowever, it was difficult to maximize the model’s performance due to the small number of variables and data, suggesting that additional factors such as credit scores and debt ratios were needed. In addition, if the multicollinearity problem, which reveals a strong correlation between predictors, has been solved, better performance can be expected in the linear regression model."
